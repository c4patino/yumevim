# „ÇÜ„ÇÅ„É¥„Ç£„É† (yumevim)

A modular, extensible, and maintainable Neovim configuration system written in
pure Lua. yumevim-lua is designed for users who want a customizable and
portable Neovim setup, leveraging Lua for plugin management, language tooling,
and editor settings‚Äîno Nix required.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Pure Lua-based**: No Nix or external system dependencies required.
- **Highly Modular**: Organized by feature (UI, navigation, language support,
  utilities, etc.) for easy customization.
- **Plugin Management**: Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
  or compatible Lua plugin managers.
- **Language Support**: Built-in LSP, DAP, Treesitter, snippets, and formatting
  for many languages.
- **Rich UI & Navigation**: Modern statusline, notifications, dashboard,
  Telescope, Harpoon, file tree, and more.
- **Easy Customization**: Edit Lua modules directly for your preferences.
